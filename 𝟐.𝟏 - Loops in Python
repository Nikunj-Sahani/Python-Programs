      >> Loops in Python are constructs that allow you to execute a block of code multiple times.

      >>  Python provides two main types of loops:
          :1: For Loop >> Used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range).

          :2: While Loop >> Repeats as long as a condition is true.
