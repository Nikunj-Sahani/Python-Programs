      Python is an easy to understand , general purpose  and high level programming language. It design philosophy to emphasises code readability.
      It was developed by " 𝙂𝙪𝙞𝙙𝙤 𝙫𝙖𝙣 𝙍𝙤𝙨𝙨𝙪𝙢 " in 1991.

    Python is popular language because It is known for its simplicity , readability , and ease to use. It is an execellent choice for beginners as well as experienced programmers.

 Python is versatile and widely used in every technical field.

   > Easy to Code
   > Improve productivity
   > Vast library Support
   > A lot of career options for you
   > Used almost everywhere

      >> Interpreted Language --> Code is executed line by line without converting into object code.

      >> Platform independence --> It work on diffferent platform like windows , macOS , raspberry PI , etc.

      >> Free --> Python is free that anyone can use it by his own learning.

      >> Less code, more efficient --> Python syntax permit programmers to write code in less lines & create its interpretation faster.

     Setting up a software environment for Python programming.

     1. Anaconda      -- Server based tool
     2. VS Code       -- Software 
     3. Google collab -- Cloud based

  These tools are easy to use and best to code apart from others.

   1. 𝑨𝒏𝒂𝒄𝒐𝒏𝒅𝒂
       Link - https://www.anaconda.com/download/success
               Steps -
                 Complete installation --> open Anaconda  --> Get the Jupyter & Launch it --> Got the interface to Code.

   2. 𝑽𝒊𝒓𝒕𝒖𝒂𝒍 𝑺𝒕𝒖𝒅𝒊𝒐 𝑪𝒐𝒅𝒆

     >> Python 2 --> Python version 2 release in 2000.   It used to print the statement by print function.
                     for exmple --
                 print "Hello World"   ,,This code is print in python v.2.

     >> Python 3 -->Python version 3 release in 2008.  It used to print the statement by print() function.
                     for exmple --
                 print ("Hello World")   ,,This code is print in python v.3.

           You can directly type python code into the python interpreter, the interpreter executes each line as you enter it,
           providing the output immediately. It is suitable for writing very short programs.
          
             for exmple --
                <> a = 2
                   b = 6
                   c = a ** b
                   print(c)  #output - 64

                <> print("Good Morning")
                            #output - Good Morning
 
                <> print(8 + 10)
                            #output - 18

                    > It gives instant result of code.
                    > You can easily test & debug lines of code.

                 You need to write your python code in a text file and save it with the .py extension. This file called script, 
                 saved and executed using python interpreter.

           :: Points to view -
                    > Scripts allow to organise and manage the codes.
                    > It allow code resuablity.
                    > It allow to run larger and extensive programs.
                    > Late result of code because it debug entire codes.
