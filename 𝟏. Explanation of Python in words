      >> Platform independence --> It work on diffferent platform like windows , macOS , raspberry PI , etc.

      >> Free --> Python is free that anyone can use it by his own learning.

      >> Less code, more efficient --> Python syntax permit programmers to write code in less lines & create its interpretation faster.
