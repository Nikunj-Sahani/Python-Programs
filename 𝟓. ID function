  (Easy to understand) --> It returns the unique identity number of object that represents memory location.

    The id() function in Python is a built-in function that returns the unique identifier for a specified object.
    This identifier is an integer that represents the memory address of the object, which is guaranteed to be unique and constant for the object during its lifetime.

       Example --

  𝙋𝙮𝙩𝙝𝙤𝙣 𝙘𝙤𝙙𝙚 >>  x = 10
                       #  X is a " Variable "  (Using hastag is a comment for the code)
                       # 10 is a " Object "
                  print(x)
                  print(id(x))

   Output - 10
            138489129316648 ,, 140729613150936      :: You got this type of identity number,
            :: You got one ID for a object randomly.
